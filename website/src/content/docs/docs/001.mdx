description: How to use hyt, hydent official tool.
---

**hyt** is a tool for effient developing in hydent. We insistly recommend you to use it.

hyt has a lot of functions, though we introduce one of them, a function to run hydent.

Let's move to in your workspace directory and then make an empty file named "hello_world.hyt".

Open your file and copy and paste below.

```hello_world.hyt
import { println } from "std/io";

fn main() {
    println("Hello World!");
}

```

then...

```bash
$ hyt run hello_world.hyt
```

You will see "Hello World!" message. This is the easiest way to run hydent. hyt interpreted your program.

If you want to run it more faster, you should add "--build" flag.

```bash
$ hyt run hello_world.hyt --build
```

"hyt" will compile hello_world.hyt into machine code in a little long time, and instantly run the binary. It's very first!

You will run your program in interpreter to check if your program run collectly, then compile it into binary runnable in high speed, and release.

If you want to use multiple files, you can create workspace and manage by hyt.

```bash
$ hyt new your_workspace_name
```

hyt creates directory and a few files.

```tree
your_workspace_name
├── src
│   └── main.hyt
├── deps.json
└── .gitignore
```
