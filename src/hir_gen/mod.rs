//! This module is responsible for High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR) generation.
//!
//! It transforms the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into a more semantically rich
//! and compiler-friendly representation, performing initial semantic checks
//! and desugaring of high-level language constructs.
